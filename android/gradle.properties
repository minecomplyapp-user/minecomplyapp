# Project-wide Gradle settings.

# IDE (e.g. Android Studio) users:
# Gradle settings configured through the IDE *will override*

# For more details on how to configure your build environment visit

# Specifies the JVM arguments used for the daemon process.
# The setting is particularly useful for tweaking memory settings.
# Default value: -Xmx512m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m
# ✅ MAXIMUM MEMORY for new architecture builds
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx8192m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=2048m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:+UseParallelGC

# When configured, Gradle will run in incubating parallel mode.
# This option should only be used with decoupled projects. More details, visit
# http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#sec:decoupled_projects
# ✅ DISABLED to reduce memory pressure during build

# AndroidX package structure to make it clearer which packages are bundled with the
# Android operating system, and which are packaged with your app's APK

# Use this property to specify which architecture you want to build.
# You can also override it from the CLI using
# ./gradlew <task> -PreactNativeArchitectures=x86_64
# ✅ BUILD FOR MULTIPLE ARCHITECTURES for broader device compatibility
# arm64-v8a (modern 64-bit) + armeabi-v7a (older 32-bit devices)
reactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a

# Use this property to enable support to the new architecture.
# This will allow you to use TurboModules and the Fabric render in
# your application. You should enable this flag either if you want
# to write custom TurboModules/Fabric components OR use libraries that
# are providing them.
# ✅ ENABLED - Required for Reanimated 4.x with RN 0.81.5
newArchEnabled=true

# Use this property to enable or disable the Hermes JS engine.
# If set to false, you will be using JSC instead.
hermesEnabled=true

# Use this property to enable edge-to-edge display support.
# This allows your app to draw behind system bars for an immersive UI.
# Note: Only works with ReactActivity and should not be used with custom Activity.
edgeToEdgeEnabled=true

# Enable GIF support in React Native images (~200 B increase)
expo.gif.enabled=true
# Enable webp support in React Native images (~85 KB increase)
expo.webp.enabled=true
# Enable animated webp support (~3.4 MB increase)
# Disabled by default because iOS doesn't support animated webp
expo.webp.animated=false

# Enable network inspector
EX_DEV_CLIENT_NETWORK_INSPECTOR=true

# Use legacy packaging to compress native libraries in the resulting APK.
expo.useLegacyPackaging=false

# Specifies whether the app is configured to use edge-to-edge via the app config or plugin
# WARNING: This property has been deprecated and will be removed in Expo SDK 55. Use `edgeToEdgeEnabled` or `react.edgeToEdgeEnabled` to determine whether the project is using edge-to-edge.
